/*
 * Looks like NGC uses 16bits to store the encoder value.
 * So depending on the resolution, it either returns a 
 * uint16_t value or int16_t value.
 *
 * So if you have a resolution < 2^15, then the range is:
 * -resolution to (resolution-1)
 *
 * If your resolution is larger, then the range is:
 * 0 to 2^16-1
 *
 * It's so far undocumented how encoders mounted backwards
 * with a negative resolution should be handled for the
 * latter situation.  I decided to do the semi-obvious thing
 * of wrapping between 0-(Resolution - 1)
